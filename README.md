# Metagenomic Investigation of Viral Diversity in Hospital Sludge Water (Ongoing)

## Overview
This project explores viral diversity in hospital sludge water using shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

## Workflow
- Assembly of reads using MEGAHIT  
- Identification of viral contigs using VirSorter2  
- Taxonomic classification using ViTax  
- Relative abundance estimation using CoverM  

## Environment
- Linux / Ubuntu-based analysis
- Command-line bioinformatics tools

## My Role
- Assisting in data processing and workflow execution  
- Contributing to viral identification and classification  
- Working collaboratively with lab team  

## Status
Analysis ongoing; results under interpretation.
